SaltyScope is a bot betting tool for SaltyBet based on SaltyBoy. <br><br>

It was designed to run based on fighter calls, rather than match calls, because the SaltyBoy scraper API seems to have routine issues.<br><br>
SaltyScope does NOT collect any personally identifiable information (PII) about its users. <br>
The application only requires use of local storage to allow the preferences to be saved to your extension cache.<br>
This allows you to retain settings like your betting mode, amounts and customizations.<br><br>

Again, this information is NOT transmitted back to me, and is ONLY used for local storage.<br>
NO PII of any kind is transmitted or retained by me. <br><br>

Thanks for using SaltyScope!
